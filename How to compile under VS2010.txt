3/28/2014 64 bit instructions, 32 bit instructions at the end of this file
glut32 cannot be used , rather use the files that are in C:\levolver\yonkang-sefit\levolver64\glut64 There is a note in the directory: "glut.def is for 32 bit"
Also, "glut.h" has to be modified:
#    //pragma comment (lib, "glut32.lib")   /* link with Win32 GLUT lib */

In order to compile Ben Semerjian's lpng1218 code this directory was created:
C:\levolver\yonkang-sefit\levolver64\ev_ogl\lpng1218x64\lib64
Created by running Visual Studio x64 Win64 Command Prompt (2010), which gives plenty of warnings,
C:\levolver\yonkang-sefit\levolver64\ev_ogl\lpng1218x64\lpng1218\makeLibs.bat

metis was updated and rebuilt for 64 bit here :
C:\metis\metis-5.1.0\build\windows\libmetis\Debug

Addendum
opengl32 is actually 64 bit if you take it from this directory:
%ProgramFiles%\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\<version>\Lib\x64\OpenGL32.lib

glutgraph.c was modified and needs to eventually be changed such that it is both 32 bit and 64 bit compatible:

#include <stdio.h>     // added by Y Chen, 10/13/2010
//#include <windows.h>
//#include "glut/glut.h"		// Changed by PSU.
#include "../glut64/glut.h"		// Changed by  to support 64 bit build, Ben Schaeffer 3/21/2014

//Following chunk of code added by PSU.
#include "lpng1218/xplanet_png.c"   //PNG library.
//changed #pragma code to support 64 bit build, Ben Schaeffer 3/21/2014
#pragma comment(lib, "lib64/png.lib")
#pragma comment(lib, "lib64/pngerror.lib")

Under the projects property pages|Configuration Properties|C/C++|General|Additional Include Directories: 
C:\metis\metis-4.0\lib;%Program Files%\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.0A\Include\gl;%(AdditionalIncludeDirectories)

For some reason the following does not correctly compile: 
%Program Files%\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.0A\Include\gl;C:\metis\metis-5.1.0\include;%(AdditionalIncludeDirectories)

Even though later on linking is performed with metis-5.1.0 libraries

----------
6/19/2012 (old instructions for building 32 bit version)

The program "levolver" is a modified version of Surface Evolver with a Fluid Interface Tool layer added for exchanging information with the "SE-FIT.exe" graphical user interface.

Notes for building "levolver":

Step one. Copy "glut" and "metis" to the root directory "c:\" (at PSU they are both on "Y:\yongkang\FIT DEV\MISC")

Step two. Compile the solution "ev_ogl.sln". There may be a final error message about being unable to copy the file which can be ignored.

Step three. Copy and rename the executable file to the directory where "SE-FIT.exe" is: "C:\levolver\ev_ogl_20111205\ev_ogl\Release\levolver.exe" -> "C:\sefit\levolver.exe". The file "glut32.dll" must also reside in the target directory, i.e. "C:\sefit\".
